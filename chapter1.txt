The old wooden door creaked open, revealing a hidden garden. 
The scent of blooming flowers and fresh earth filled the air. 
A small, winding path led to a tranquil pond, where a lone swan glided effortlessly across the water. 
As the sun dipped below the horizon, the garden transformed into a serene haven, where time stood still.
